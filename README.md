# Bobtools: Some simple convenience functions for Python 3.7+

This package is still very rough. Currently implemented:

- `bobtools.parallel.funnel` : an easy fan-out, fan-in function for parallel processing of streams. 
- `bobtools.datascan.dictscanner` : An object to extract the schema and prototype from (nested) dictionary data.
